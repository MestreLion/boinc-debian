boinc (6.1.13-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules:
    - Don't clean lib/boinccmd, *.unmodified and other files by hand in the
      clean-patched target, since they are now removed by upstream's
      makefiles on "make clean".
  * Removed the man pages for boinc_client, boinc_cmd, and boincmgr from the
    Debian-diff because they are now included in the upstream source and also
    handled by upstream's makefiles.
  * Rewrote debian/copyright in the format which is described in this wiki
    page: http://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/CopyrightFormat

  +++ Changes unsuitable for the trunk branch:

  * Updates for the new Python policy:
    - Added python-support (>= 0.4.2) to Build-Depends.
    - Replaced dh_python with dh_pysupport in debian/rules.
  * debian/control:
    - Added "tcsh | c-shell" to boinc-server's Depends field since
      tools/db_query and tools/watch_tcp use /bin/csh as interpreter.
    - Removed all php4 packages from boinc-server's Depends because php4
      will not be supported during lenny's life cycle.
  * debian/boinc-server.README.Debian: Added README.Debian which is at the
    moment only a pointer to http://wiki.debian.org/BOINC/Server.
  * debian/boinc-server.install:
    - Added: db/init_db, sched/db_dump_spec.xml, test/uc_result,
      test/uc_wu_nodelete, tools/cleanlogs.sh, tools/create_work_example,
      tools/makelog.sh, tools/project.xml and tools/run_in_ops.
      Some of them were required by the tools/make_project script.
    - Removed: tools/add (long deprecated upstream).
  * debian/rules:
    - Don't fix PHP shebangs of files in html/ops/ and removed other
      permission fixes, because they were fixed upstream.

  * debian/control: Updated boinc-dev's dependency on the concrete

  * debian/rules: Do not declare the patch and unpatch targets as phony,
    because the included /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make does this already.

boinc (5.10.42-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Make the scripts /usr/share/bug/boinc-client/script and
    /usr/share/doc/boinc-manager/examples/run-boincmgr executable because
    they have a shebang. Thanks Lintian for noticing this.
  * debian/patches/: Updated 101_fix_memory_detection_on_kfreebsd.patch for
    the new release.
  * debian/watch: Only check for versions with an even minor version number.
    Versions with an odd minor version number are test releases which are not
    intended for a wider audience.
  * Reverted the debhelper compat level bump. It was just unnecessary (boinc
    does not need V6) and it would have made backporting harder.
  * Merged the workaround from Ubuntu's 5.10.30-5ubuntu3 for Linux's new CFS
    with the following changes:
    - Renamed debian/extra/udev-usr_share to debian/extra/udev-cpu_share
      because this name seems to be more appropriate since this script changes
      the boinc user's cpu_share.
    - Install udev-cpu_share into /usr/share/boinc-client instead of
      /usr/lib/boinc-client since it is an architecture-independent shell
      script.
    - Use lowercase variables in the init script because UID is set by bash
      and it complains when trying to overwrite it.
    Thanks to Daniel Hahler <daniel@thequod.de> for investigating this issue
    and the patch. (closes: #461630)

boinc (5.10.30-5ubuntu2) hardy; urgency=low

  * Revert changes from ubuntu1 and instead use the uevent udev
    interface to assign the lowest possible cpu_share to the
    boinc user. This is still considered to be a workaround.
    - Add debian/boinc-client.udev
    - debian/rules: call dh_installudev
    - Add debian/extra/udev-usr_share, which gets run by udevd
    - Drop debian/patches/ubuntu_temp_cfs_fix.patch
  * debian/boinc-client.init: Display cpu_share info for "status"

boinc (5.10.30-5ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/ubuntu_temp_cfs_fix.patch:
    Temporary workaround for the new CFS Linux scheduler,
    by adjusting the "boinc" user's cpu_share to the minimum (2)
    in the init script (LP: #177713)
  * Modify Maintainer value to match the DebianMaintainerField
    specification.

boinc (5.10.30-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/manpages/update-boinc-applinks.xml: Updated from DocBook 4.2 to
    4.4, which is the latest version in etch.
  * Added debian/watch file, which uses Subversion's directory listing of the
    tags directory to determine the upstream version. Therefore this is only
    useful for version comparison (e.g. for DEHS and DDPO).
  * Bumped debhelper compat level from V5 to V6 since this is the current
    recommended level and raised the build dependency to "debhelper (>= 6)".
  * Removed debian/patches/103_fix_terminal_activity_detection.patch in favor
    of adding the --check_all_logins option to the default BOINC_OPTS in
    boinc-client's init script.

  [ Debconf translations ]
  * Added Swedish (sv.po) by Christer Andersson <klamm@comhem.se>.

boinc (5.10.30-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/manpages/update-boinc-applinks.xml: Fixed Lintian's informational
    tag "I: hyphen-used-as-minus-sign" by enclosing options in <command>
    elements with the <option> element.
  * debian/rules:
    - Official BOINC platforms for some Debian GNU/Linux ports (alpha, ia64,
      powerpc, and sparc) were assigned upstream and therefore changed these
      platforms accordingly:
      -   alpha-unknown-linux-gnu ->  alpha-hp-linux-gnu
      -    ia64-unknown-linux-gnu ->      ia64-linux-gnu
      - powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu ->   powerpc-linux-gnu
      -   sparc-unknown-linux-gnu -> sparc-sun-linux-gnu
    - Removed the --target and --program-prefix options from TYPE_FLAGS,
      because they are not required to set the BOINC platform anymore.

boinc (5.10.30-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/patches/:
    - Renamed 201_missing_headers_for_gcc4.3.patch to 102_... because it has
      been applied upstream in r14436.
    - Added 103_fix_terminal_activity_detection.patch to fix the activity
      detection in terminal applications. (closes: #448982)
  * debian/rules: Pass "LDFLAGS=-Wl,--as-needed" to configure in order to
    remove unnecessary library dependencies.
  * debian/boinc-client.postinst: Changed the default permission of the
    global_prefs_override.xml conffile from 0644 to 0664 so that local
    preferences are saved when GUI RPCs are used to set them. (closes: #458007)

boinc (5.10.30-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/rules: Wrote get-orig-source target which fetches the latest tagged
    BOINC version.
  * debian/patches/:
    - Added 201_missing_headers_for_gcc4.3.patch which adds missing C++
      headers to several source files. This is required to fix a FTBFS with
      recent GCC 4.3 snapshots. Thanks to Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com>
      for the bug report. (closes: #456041)
    - Added 101_fix_memory_detection_on_kfreebsd.patch from upstream r14415
      based on a patch by Andrew Deason <adeason2@uiuc.edu> which fixes memory
      detection on Debian GNU/kFreeBSD. (closes: #456586)

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/boinc-client.default: Removed --return_results_immediately from the
    example BOINC_OPTS variable, because this command line option is not
    implemented and won't be available in BOINC >= 6.1, see upstream r14280.
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version from 3.7.2 to 3.7.3, no changes required.
    - Changed my maintainer address to fst@debian.org.

  [ Thibaut VARENE ]
  * debian/boinc-client.{init,default}: Added option to enable advanced
    scheduling of the client and its sub-processes by default.

boinc (5.10.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * New upstream release. (closes: #447929)
    - Handles change in /proc/cpuinfo on powerpc introduced in Linux 2.6.23.
      Thanks to Thibaut VARENE <varenet@debian.org> for the patch.
      (closes: #437459)
    - Allows to set arbitrary many alternate platforms in the client's config
      file cc_config.xml with the <alt_platform> element which is a direct
      child of the <options> element. (closes: #437326)
    - BOINC Manager: At account creation check if wxGetUserName() returned an
      empty string and if it did use the output of wxGetUserId() instead.
      Thanks to Morita Sho <morita-pub-en-debian@inz.sakura.ne.jp> for the
      excellent bug report. (closes: #447320)
  * debian/control:
    - Moved Homepage pseudo field in the long descriptions to the source stanza
      because this is now a propper debian/control field supported by dpkg.
    - Removed XS- prefix from Vcs fields since they are now officially
      supported by dpkg.
  * debian/boinc-client.init: Print the scheduling status of boinc_client's
    children only if there are any present, otherwise schedtool would be
    called without arguments and would print its usage text.
  * debian/icons/: Use icons with transparent background.
  * debian/boinc-manager.desktop:
    - Addded Portuguese translations for GenericName and Comment, thanks to
      Marco Rodrigues <gothicx@sapo.pt>.
    - Monitor is a subcategory of the System main category, so use System
      instead of Utility.
    - Removed the Encoding key since it is deprecated in the Desktop Entry
      Specification 1.0 and added the Version key.

boinc (5.10.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/boinc-manager.menu: Changed section for the new menu hierarchy from
    "Apps/Tools" to "Applications/System/Monitoring".
  * debian/icons/: Updated icons to the new BOINC logo.
  * debian/boinc-client.init:
    - Added patch to use advanced scheduling for the client and it's children
      using the schedtool and ionice utilities. For now advanced scheduling is
      disabled by default. Invoke the init script with the schedule option to
      enable it. Thanks to Omen Wild <dbug4.flibble@mandarb.com> for the
      patch. (closes: #423259)
    - Specified default values for the variables of the /etc/default file and
      changed script to exit quietly if the default $BOINC_CLIENT is used but
      not present so that it does not fail if the boinc-client package was
      removed but not purged. Both is required by the Debian Policy.
  * debian/control:
    - Added schedtool, which if installed can be used for advanced scheduling
      in boinc-client's init script, to boinc-client's Suggest field.
    - Made boinc-dbg dependent on "boinc-client (= ${binary:Version})" or
      "boinc-manager (= ${binary:Version})" to ensure that the versions
      between the debug and program packages do not differ.
    - Since GCC 4.2 is now the default compiler, updated boinc-dev's
      dependency on libstdc++-dev to the concrete package libstdc++6-4.2-dev.
  * debian/rules:
    - Added --with-boinc-platform=... to TYPE_FLAGS being another attempt to
      get the right platform name on ppc64.
    - Changed the BOINC platform on kfreebsd-i386 from i486-pc-kfreebsd-gnu to
      i686-pc-kfreebsd-gnu to be consistent with the platform name for i386
      and made i686-pc-kfreebsd-gnu an alternate platform for
      x86_64-pc-kfreebsd-gnu.
    - Set powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu as alternate platform for ppc64-linux-gnu.
  * debian/boinc-client.postrm: Use the --system option for deluser/delgroup
    to ensure that we are removing system accounts only and mask the
    deluser/delgroup calls because adduser is not essential and we can't rely
    on non-essential packages to be present during the purge phase. This would
    be a Policy violation, see section 7.2.

  [ Debconf translations ]
  * Added Spanish (es.po) by Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña
    <jfs@computer.org>. (closes: #437379)
  * Added Slovak (sk.po) by helix84 <helix84@centrum.sk>. (closes: #437670)

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Fixed wrong CPU information on alpha, hppa, ia64, ppc and sparc.
      (closes: #406853)
    - Use i686-pc-linux-gnu as alternative platform name for
      x86_64-pc-linux-gnu to get i386 binaries on amd64. (closes: #366741)
      Hence all traces to our own mechanism to override the platform name on
      amd64 have been removed:
      - debian/patches/001_amd64_disable_platform_reset.patch
      - debian/extra/use-32bit-on-amd64.sh
      - the associated paragraph from debian/boinc-client.README.Debian
  * Updated boinc_client's, boinc_cmd's and boincmgr's manual pages for the
    new release.
  * debian/boinc-client.{init,default}: Use two dashes for boinc_client's
    command line options instead of one because that is it's default now.
  * debian/boinc-client.postinst: Use "[ ... ] && [ ... ]" instead of
    "[ ... -a ... ]" because these constructs are much easier to read.
  * debian/boinc-client.preinst: Use dpkg-query instead of poking directly
    into the dpkg status file. See this thread for more information:
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/05/msg01070.html
  * debian/conffiles/{cc_config.xml,global_prefs_override.xml}: Added comments
    which explain the purpose of each configuration file and which contain
    URLs to upstream documentation for each of them.
  * debian/copyright:
    - State that the source code is obtained via Subversion (and not via CVS)
      and added a pointer to debian/README.Debian-source.
    - Updated for the new release.
  * Added /usr/share/bug/boinc-client/script which pastes boinc-client's
    init script configuration file (/etc/default/boinc-client) into bug
    reports because this might be helpful for debugging.
  * extra/bash/boinc: Added bash completion for boinc_client and boinc_cmd.
  * debian/rules:
    - Don't ignore $(MAKE) distclean errors to make lintian happy.
    - Install unstripped versions of boinc_client, boinc_cmd and boincmgr
      and let dh_strip do this job for us. Now building BOINC with
      DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="nostrip" actually does what it should do.
  * debian/patches/: Added 002_remove_hardcoded_optimization.patch to remove
    hardcoded compiler flags from client/Makefile.am and to make debian/rules
    the only place again where compiler flags are defined.
    (probably closes: #427661)
  * New boinc-dbg package added to provide debugging symbols for BOINC
    binaries.
  * debian/boinc-dev.{install,links}:
    - Don't install lib/common_defs.h manually, "make install" does this now.
    - Create a symlink in /usr/share/boinc-dev/lib/ to the new str_util.h.

boinc (5.8.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/control:
    - Extended boinc-manager's long description.
    - Added libcurl4-openssl-dev to Build-Depends because the libcurl packages
      have bumped sonames. The B-D on libcurl3-openssl-dev remains as
      alternative dependency to ease backporting to etch.
      (closes: #424501, #425225)
  * Updated all BOINC URLs to point to their new location in the official
    BOINC wiki according to http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/FileList.
  * debian/boinc-dev.{install,links}: Install lib/common_defs.h header to fix
    a FTBFS of boinc-app-seti with boinc-dev/5.8.17-1. This was discovered by
    Lucas Nussbaum's archive rebuild. (closes: #422643)
  * debian/manpages/*.xml: Made <ulink> elements empty if their content was

boinc (5.8.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * New upstream release.
    - BOINC Manager:
      - Broadened "Options" dialog so that labels does not get truncated.
        (closes: #389840)
      - Display project names in "Reset Project" dialog correctly. (LP: #83708)
      - Fixed run mode entries in "Activity" menu. (LP: #93850)
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped versioned Build-Depends on libcurl3-openssl-dev to >= 7.15.5
      which is required for the bandwith-throttling feature. Also removed the
      alternative on libcurl-ssl-dev because this was only added to aid
      backporting BOINC to sarge but sarge has only libcurl3-dev/7.13.2.
    - Added libxml2-utils to Build-Depends for xmllint which is used in the
      unit-test target in debian/rules.
  * debian/rules:
    - Added the unit-test target which uses xmllint to check if the XML
      conffiles cc_config.xml and global_prefs_override.xml are well-formed.
    - Since backporting to sarge is not possible any more, also removed the
      compatibility code for sarge's version of dpkg-architecture.
    - On ppc64 use ppc64-linux-gnu as BOINC platform (which is the official
      BOINC platform) instead of powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu.
  * Switched patch system from dpatch to quilt.
  * debian/patches/:
    - Updated 001_amd64_disable_platform_reset.patch for the new release.
    - Updated 003_use_sensible-browser.patch for the new release.
    - Added 101_gcc_4.3_fixes.patch that fixes a FTBFS with GCC 4.3, thanks to
      Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com>. (closes: #413307)
  * debian/boinc-client.postinst: Change the permission and ownership of
    boinc-client's conffiles from 0644 boinc:boinc to 0640 root:boinc for
    gui_rpc_auth.cfg and to 0644 root:boinc for the rest but only if no
    "stat override" exists. (closes: #407678)
  * debian/boinc-client.postrm: Changed postrm so it does not fail if debconf
    is not available. (closes: #416663)
  * Replaced the log_flags.xml conffile with cc_config.xml:
    - Added debian/boinc-client.preinst which removes the obsolete conffile
      /etc/boinc-client/log_flags.xml if it was not modified locally or
      renames it to /etc/boinc-client/log_flags.xml.dpkg-bak if it was.
    - Added debian/boinc-client.NEWS which explains that the conffile
      /etc/boinc-client/log_flags.xml is now obsolete and is superseded by
      /etc/boinc-client/cc_config.xml.
  * Added the run-boincmgr shell script as example to the boinc-manager
    package. This script sources /etc/default/boinc-client and chdir into
    $BOINC_DIR before starting boincmgr so that the BOINC Manager can read the
    password from $BOINC_DIR/gui_rpc_auth.cfg file. See Ubuntu bug #48768 for
    more details.
  * debian/boinc-client.README.Debian: Added paragraph "Mass deployment of
    boinc-client that automatically attach to an Account Manager" which points
    (at the moment) to T-Bone's post on the pkg-boinc-devel mailing list.
  * debian/boinc-client.install: Install the switcher binary into
    /usr/lib/boinc-client/.
  * debian/boinc-dev.{install,links}:
    - Don't install lib/error_numbers.h, lib/gui_rpc_client.h,
      lib/std_fixes.h, config.h and version.h manually because they are now
      installed by the upstream makefiles.
    - Added lib/md5_file.h to boinc-dev as requested by Alex Owen.
  * Added ca-certificates to boinc-client's Depends field and create the
    ca-bundle.crt symlink (which points to /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates) in
    Debian's default BOINC data directory (/var/lib/boinc-client/) in
    boinc-client.postinst.
  * Updated boinc_cmd's and boincmgr's manual pages for the new release.
  * Updated debian/copyright for the new release.

  * clientgui/ValidateEmailAddress.cpp: Use a much simpler regex to validate
    e-mail addresses. This also allows addresses that contain '+' in their
    local-part. This regex is also used in BOINC's PHP function
    is_valid_email_address() in html/inc/email.inc. (closes: #393948)

boinc (5.4.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * Use debconf to ask whether the default BOINC data directory
    /var/lib/boinc-client should be removed while purging the boinc-client
    package. The wording of the template was taken from the
    dbconfig-common/purge template.
  * debian/control:
    - Added po-debconf to Build-Depends because debconf-updatepo is called in
      the clean target of debian/rules.
    - Added XS-Vcs-Svn field to the source stanza.
    - Changed order of Build-Depends: List packages that are needed for the
      packaging first, then list packages that are needed to compile the
      upstream source.
  * debian/rules:
    - When using the --target configure option also append --program-prefix=""
      to avoid that programs are prefixed with "i686-pc-linux-gnu-".
    - Install the checkin_notes file as upstream changelog.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Added copyright note about the Debian packaging.

boinc (5.4.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Added the header file lib/gui_rpc_client.h to the boinc-dev package as
    requested by Folkert van Heusden.
  * debian/control:
    - Removed Greg Norris <adric@debian.org> from the Uploaders field.
  * debian/rules:
    - Applied patch from Robert Millan <rmh@aybabtu.com> which simplifies the
      platform override for i386. We are now using --target instead of the
      --build and --host switches. This also needed some changes in
      boinc-client.install and boinc-manager.install. Thanks Robert for the
      patch. (closes: #383871)
  * debian/patches/:
    - Added 01_amd64-disable-platform-reset.dpatch from Robert Millan
      <rmh@aybabtu.com>. This patch prevents that projects are reset when the
      platform name in client_state.xml does not match the platform name the
      client was compiled for and it also sets the platform name from
      client_state.xml as the valid platform name which will be used for
      scheduler requests. This patch only affects AMD64. (related to: #366741)
  * Explain in boinc-client's README.Debian how to modify the BOINC core
    client so that it downloads 32bit applications on AMD64. The
    01_amd64-disable-platform-reset.dpatch patch is mandatory for this
    procedure to work correctly. (also related to: #366741, LP#51948)
  * Added two helper scripts (move-boinc-dir.sh and use-32bit-on-amd64.sh)
    as examples in the boinc-client package.

  * Removed -ffast-math from the client's optimization flags because it causes
    a floating point exception on Alpha when the client is started.
    (closes: #379137)
  * Added conffile /etc/boinc-client/log_flags.xml which can be used to turn
    on/off logging and debugging messages. For a detailed list of messages
    that can be turned on/off, see http://boinc.berkeley.edu/client_msgs.php
    Note that this file was renamed to cc_config.xml in BOINC (>= 5.5.2).
  * Applied patches from Peter Bailis <pbailis@gmail.com> for the boinc_cmd
    manual page. Thanks again Peter!
  * debian/control:

  * New upstream release.
    - Display Account Manager names correctly in BOINC Manager. This fixes
      Ubuntu bug #48246.
  * debian/control: 
    - Really bumped the Standards-Version to 3.7.2.
  * Added the boinc_gl.h header to the boinc-dev package. This file is needed
    to compile SETI@home's graphics component.
  * Added a hint to use "update-alternatives --set x-www-browser [...]" to
    manually set the x-www-browser alternative to boinc-manager's
    README.Debian. See Ubuntu bug #48766 for more details.
  * Use /usr/bin/python as interpreter for update-boinc-applinks instead of
    /usr/bin/python2.4 and make boinc-client depend on "python (>= 2.3)" to
    avoid the unnecessary strict dependency on Python 2.4.
  * Made debian/rules compatible with sarge's version of dpkg-architecture and
    added libcurl-ssl-dev as alternative for the libcurl3-openssl-dev build
    dependency. These changes aid in backporting BOINC to sarge. Thanks to
    Robert Millan for the patch. (closes: #373089)

  * debian/patches/:
    - Removed 02_wx2.6-configure.ac.dpatch and 03_wx2.6-with-unicode.dpatch,
      both were included upstream.
    - Updated 07_use-sensible-browser.dpatch to use sensible-browser only,
      because upstream's attempt to start a browser fails miserably.

    - Updated 03_wx2.6-with-unicode.dpatch and 07_use-sensible-browser.dpatch
      for the new upstream release.
  * Added conffile /etc/boinc-client/global_prefs_override.xml which can be
    used to edit preferences locally. For more information about this file,
    see http://boinc.berkeley.edu/prefs_override.php
  * Clarified and expanded the explanation of the -no_gui_rpc option in
    boinc_client's manpage based on Steffen's suggestion. Thanks to
    David Coe for the report. (closes: #362257)
  * Added the update-boinc-applinks tool that creates (or removes) symlinks to
    "anonymous" BOINC applications and their app_info.xml files in a given
    data directory. The "anonymous" applications and their app_info.xml files
    are provided by boinc-app-* packages (e.g. boinc-app-seti). Note that
    currently there are no boinc-app-* packages in the Debian archive.

boinc (5.2.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Call configure properly with the --build and --host switches as
      described in autotools-dev's README.Debian.
    - Remove *.unmodified binaries in the clean target, because those files
      are not removed by make distclean. This is needed to rebuild the
      packages in an already used source tree.
    - Update config.guess and config.sub from the autotools-dev package to add
      support for GNU/k*BSD.
  * debian/patches/:
    - Added 10_exclude-sea.dpatch to prevent building the self-extracting
      archive, since we don't need it in any case and this fixes a FTBFS on
      non-Linux hosts.
    - Modified 03_wx2.6-with-unicode.dpatch to fix Alioth bug #303021.

boinc (5.2.15-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/patches/:
    - Added 07_use-sensible-browser.dpatch. The BOINC Manager now uses
      "sensible-browser", which is part of the debianutils package, as
      fallback if wxWidgets' method to determine the default browser fails.
      Thanks to Olek Wojnar for the report and his helpful investigations.
  * debian/boinc-client.postrm: 
    - Be more verbose when removing the "boinc" user/group.
  * debian/boinc-manager.desktop:
    - Added "Path: /var/lib/boinc-client" so that the BOINC Manager can find
      the "gui_rpc_auth.cfg" file and does not ask for a password. This should
      be removed when the BOINC Manager is able to store passwords in its
      config file.
  * debian/control:
    - Added an extra space before the "Homepage" pseudo field according to the
      Developer's Reference, Section 6.2.4.
    - Added Christoph Martin <christoph.martin@uni-mainz.de> and
      Greg Norris <adric@debian.org> to Uploaders.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Added more copyright and license information for various files.
  * Created symlinks of headers and static libraries, which are required to
    build the SETI@home application, in "/usr/share/boinc-dev/".
  * Ship a default "gui_rpc_auth.cfg" file in "/etc/boinc-client/" and create
    a symlink in "/var/lib/boinc-client" to this file. Old "gui_rpc_auth.cfg"
    files are moved to "/etc/boinc-client/" before creating the symlink.

boinc (5.2.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/patches/:
    - Removed obsolete 01_amd64-gcc4-fixes.dpatch.
    - Updated 02_wx2.6-configure.ac.dpatch for new release.
    - Updated 03_wx2.6-with-unicode.dpatch for new release.
  * debian/control:
    - Add zlib1g-dev, libssl-dev and libcurl3-openssl-dev to Build-Depends.
    - Build depend on the newer libmysqlclient14-dev package since
      libmysqlclient12-dev is scheduled to be removed.
    - Moved all packages back to main. Non-free code (RSAEuro and GLUT) has
      been removed from BOINC.
    - Added ${misc:Depends} to all packages' Depends. This variable is not
      used at the moment.
    - Use a versioned dependency for lsb-base (>= 3.0-6) to ensure that the
      log_progress_msg function is available. (fixes: Alioth bug #302179)
  * debian/copyright:
    - Added copyright and license information for various PHP libraries
      found in html/inc/.
    - Added the full text of the Mozilla Public License 1.0 since stripchart
      is distributed under the MPL.
    - Removed RSAEuro and GLUT copyright and license information since this
      code was removed upstream.
  * debian/rules:
    - Rewrote debian/rules without CDBS. CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are now forwarded
      to the build process.
    - Compile only the BOINC core client program with "-O3 -ffast-math".
    - Remove all files that are created by the autotools during the
      pre-build target in the clean target.
  * debian/boinc-client.postinst:
    - If the file "/var/lib/boinc-client/gui_rpc_auth.cfg" does not exist,
      create an empty one and make it readable by everyone. This allows
      every user on the same host to control the core client with GUI RPCs
      (eg. with "boincmgr" or "boinc_cmd").
  * The boinc-dev package now only includes headers and static libraries, that
    are installed by "make install". According to Bruce Allen this should be
    sufficient for building BOINC applications.
    (http://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/pipermail/boinc_dev/2005-October/003855.html)
  * Removed all references to RSAEuro from the boinc-dev package.
  * Added boinc-client.README.Debian that replaces boinc-client's previous
    NEWS file and explains how to use the BOINC core client in Debian.
  * Added icon to BOINC Manager's desktop file. (fixes: Alioth bug #302212)

  * Use LSB init-functions for the boinc-client init script and add lsb-base

  * debian/control.in:
    - Added libjpeg62-dev to Build-Depends.
    - boinc-manager properly conflicts with and replaces now the old boinc-gui
      package. The experimental state of this package was a lame excuse for
      not providing a smooth upgrade path in 4.27-1.

  * Created maintainer scripts to create/remove the '/var/lib/boinc-client'
    working directory and the system user/group 'boinc'.
  * Improved the boinc-client.init script and also removed the check for
    uninitialized working directories (no client_state.xml file).
  * Added .desktop file for the BOINC Manager program, thanks to Reed Hedges.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added docbook-xml to Build-Depends. Without it this package FTBFS
      (particularly docbook2x-man fails) on some systems. Thanks to 
      Adrian Zaugg for the report.
    - Added libxmu-dev and freeglut3-dev (instead of the virtual package
      freeglut-dev) to Build-Depends. Both are needed for the graphical parts

      aclocal-1.9 and automake-1.9 in debian/rules directly now.
    - Bumped Standards-Version from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2, no changes required.
  * debian/rules:
    - Use 'i686-linux-gnu' as default DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE on 'i486-linux-gnu'.
      It is still possible to override DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE with the
      BOINC_BUILD_TYPE variable.

    renamed from 'boinc_gui' to 'boincmgr', the BOINC core client binary was
    renamed to 'boinc'. This package is still experimental, so boinc-manager
    does not replace (or conflict with) boinc-gui.
  * debian/rules:
    - The BOINC_BUILD_TYPE environment variable can be used to specify
